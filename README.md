# ML_Streamlit_App
An ML app built using streamlit framework with python programming.

This is an app to predict the number of passengers survived in titanic ship.we have built a pipeline to preprocess and split the dataset in "X" & "Y" train, test split.
Here we have used XGBClassifier to train the model to predict based on train and test split.
We have used joblib library to dump the model for evaluation and to predict the recall and precision score.

Happy learning!
